### Hi there 👋

Hello, my name is ***Erico Andre da Silva*** 
I'm a software developer towards fullstack. I am a person curious about new technologies and computer languages and you will find me occasionally learning a new language or risking something related lol. Here you will find some projects that are part of my continuous learning! :blue_book: :book: 😄

The languages that I have most knowledge at the moment are **Java, Python** 👨‍💻.  👩•💻But I also have knowledge in other languages, I am currently working with **Typescript** and **Javascript**. I have also worked with frameworks such as **AngularJS, ReactJS,** among others.

By the way I am open to new ideas, new projects, if you want to talk to me feel free.
